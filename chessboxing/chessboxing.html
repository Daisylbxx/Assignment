                <p class="first2">The basic idea in Chessboxing is to combine the number one thinking sport with the
                    number one fighting sport into a hybrid that demands the most of its competitors - both mentally and
                    physically. One of the goals of this new sport is the old idea of a healthy mind in a healthy body.
                    During a Chessboxing fight the control of aggression plays a big role.

                <p>The first chessboxing competition took place in Berlin in 2003. That same year, the first world
                    championship fight was held in Amsterdam in cooperation with the Dutch Boxing Association as well as
                    the Dutch Chess Federation and under the auspices of the World Chess Boxing Organization (WCBO) that
                    was founded in Berlin shortly before. Dutch middleweight fighters Iepe Rubingh and Jean Louis
                    Veenstra faced each other in the ring. After his opponent exceeded the chess time limit, Rubingh won
                    the fight in the 11th round going down in the history books as the first-ever World Chess Boxing
                    Champion. The same goes for the Chess Boxing Club Berlin, created in the following year (2004), that
                    is the first of its kind making Berlin the birthplace of chessboxing.

                    In terms of its development into a mass sport, there was much success in 2013 and early 2014 for the
                    chessboxing world. There were more competitors in the second and third Indian Championships in
                    summer 2013 and early 2014 than in any chessboxing events ever before, with more than 245 fighters
                    varying in both age and weight class, taking place in Salem and Jodhpur, respectively. Furthermore,
                    the chessboxing community in London has continued to grow constantly since 2011 and by now stages
                    chessboxing events for 800 or more spectators on a regular basis 4–5 times a year at the Scala,

                    <p>The sport of Chessboxing is actively developing and growing as popular and favorite sport for
                        many people which try to find new realization and challenges. Actual number of local federations
                        are officially registered in countries such as: China, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Finland,
                        France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Iran, Italy, Madagascar, Mexico, Netherlands,
                        Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, USA, and others.</p>
                    <p>Chessboxing is particularly popular in India, which is currently home to the biggest chessboxing
                        foundation in the world. The sport has also become popular among Indian young and poor women
                        where the sport has been seen as an alternative to traditional roles.</p>
                    <p>In 2016, still as FIDE president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov publicly announced to "Top Sport" his desire
                        to include Chessboxing in the Olympic games.

                <p>In a chessboxing match six rounds of chess alternate with five rounds of boxing. Each round lasts
                    three minutes with one-minute breaks in between to switch from the chess table to the boxing ring. A
                    chessboxing match can end by any of the following:</p>
                <ul class="ul1">
                    <li>Victory by knockout or technical knockout in boxing</li>
                    <li>Victory by checkmate in chess</li>
                    <li>Loss due to exceeding the chess game's time control</li>
                    <li>Victory due to disqualification of his or her opponent by the referee e.g. due to inactivity
                    </li>
                    <li>Loss by resignation (chess or boxing rounds)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the case that neither of the chessboxers win in regulation time and the chess game ends in a draw,
                    the fighter who is ahead on boxing points wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is also
                    tied, the fighter that used the black chess pieces will be named the winner (due to the first-move
                    advantage in chess). This has not yet occurred in practice.</p>

            <!-- training -->
            <div class="training">
                <h1 class="tra" id="T">Particular requirements & training</h1>
                <p>A chessboxer must have strong skills in both chess and boxing in order to be permitted to compete in
                    a professional chessboxing fight. The current minimum requirements to fight in a Chess Boxing Global
                    event include an Elo rating of 1600 and a record of at least 50 amateur bouts fought in boxing or
                    another similar martial art. One deciding factor in chessboxing is that the fighters have to mainly
                    train in speed chess; the skills required by speed chess are different from those for chess using
                    classical time controls. However, chessboxing is not only the ability to master both sports but
                    above all, being able to withstand the constant switch from a full contact sport to a thinking
                    sport, round after round. After three minutes of boxing, pulses are racing, yet the opponents have
                    to face each other at the chessboard barely having taken a break, and have to then perform calmly
                    and think tactically. This switch becomes increasingly hard for the athletes as the fight goes on
                    and they become tired.
                </p>
                <p>In order to train these skills, a specialised chessboxing training is used, in which physical
                    interval training forms are combined with blitz or speed chess games. Thereby the fighters adapt the
                    rhythm of a chessboxing bout. They will use exercises like "track chess" and "stair chess" in which
                    training partners will play an 18-minute game of speed chess over six rounds with intensive running
                    exercises in between, such as 400-meter sprints or stair sprints. Other common methods of training
                    combine speed chess games with strength exercises such as push-ups. The classic chessboxing training
                    is box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.</p>
                <p>In parallel with the development of Chessboxing as a sport, it has found an increasing place in a
                    number of scientific works by leading scientists who study the potential of application of the
                    concept in various fields.
